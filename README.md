- **URGENT**: Nanoplastics amplification of deadly bacteria

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FINDING: Nanoplastics Amplify Deadly Bacteria**

### 🎯 **BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: Bacterial Virulence Amplification**

Recent peer-reviewed research published in the Journal of Nanobiotechnology (April 2025) demonstrates that nanoplastics exposure significantly amplifies bacterial virulence, particularly in Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC). This finding has immediate implications for public health.

#### 🧬 **Key Scientific Findings**
- **E. coli exposed to nanoplastics produces 3.4× more Shiga toxin**
- **Nanoplastics detected in 100% of newborn placentas tested (n=62)**
- **England reports 26% spike in STEC infections (2024 vs 2023)**
- **Industry aware of contamination since 1973, no action taken**

#### 📊 **Public Health Impact**
- **STEC infections cause 265,000 illnesses annually in the US**
- **Healthcare costs: $405 million annually in direct medical costs**
- **Nanoplastics found in 90% of bottled water samples tested**
- **Average person ingests 5 grams of plastic per week**

## 📋 **POLICY BRIEF: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED**

### 🚨 **Critical Deadlines**
- **September 18, 2025**: Congress must restore $120M NIH research funding
- **December 2025**: FDA must establish nanoplastics guidelines
- **March 2026**: EPA drinking water standards implementation

### 📋 **Policy Recommendations**
1. **RESTORE NIH FUNDING**: Immediately restore $120M NIH nanoplastics research line-item
2. **FDA GUIDELINES**: Establish mandatory testing for nanoplastics in medical supplies
3. **EPA STANDARDS**: Implement drinking water standards for nanoplastics
4. **RESEARCH PRIORITIES**: Fund research into bacterial amplification mechanisms
5. **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**: Create response protocols for amplified infections
6. **MONITORING**: Establish national nanoplastics monitoring program
7. **EDUCATION**: Develop public health campaigns on nanoplastics risks

### 🌍 **International Context**
- **European Union**: Begun regulating nanoplastics in cosmetics and consumer products
- **Canada**: Implemented nanoplastics monitoring in Great Lakes waters
- **United States**: Lags behind in both research and regulation
